# 🚑 Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard 📊  
## 🏥 Introduction

Managing an emergency room means balancing urgency, efficiency, and patient care — all under pressure. This Excel dashboard was built to address that challenge by providing a **monthly, data-driven overview** of ER operations.

It visualizes key metrics such as **departmental patient loads**, **wait times**, **gender-based trends**, and **admission status**, enabling hospital administrators to make **faster, smarter decisions**.

Designed with a focus on **clarity**, **minimalism**, and **actionable insights**, this dashboard transforms raw patient data into a **strategic tool** for improving service delivery and operational flow.
